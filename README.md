# AI Support Copilot

A production-style AI support assistant designed to demonstrate how developers can build, evaluate, and improve real-world AI-powered features using modern API workflows.

---

## 🧠 Why this project exists

AI APIs make it easy to generate responses—but building **reliable, production-ready AI systems** is much harder.

Developers often struggle with:

* Designing effective prompts
* Handling inconsistent or low-quality responses
* Debugging API failures and edge cases
* Understanding how to move from “first API call” → “real product feature”

This project bridges that gap.

It provides a **structured, developer-first approach** to building an AI support assistant—focused not just on implementation, but on **usability, reliability, and learning**.

---

## 🚀 What you’ll build

A simple but realistic **AI-powered support copilot** that:

* Accepts user queries
* Generates contextual AI responses
* Handles common failure scenarios
* Demonstrates prompt design patterns
* Includes basic evaluation of response quality

## ⚡ Quickstart

1. Clone the repository
2. Add your API key
3. Run the example:

```bash
python examples/basic_chat.py
```

For detailed setup, see 👉 [Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart.md)

## 🧩 Key Concepts Covered

### Prompt Design

* Structuring inputs for better outputs
* Using context effectively
* Avoiding common prompt mistakes

### Response Handling

* Parsing API responses
* Managing incomplete or irrelevant answers

### Failure Modes

* API errors (authentication, rate limits)
* Hallucinated or low-quality responses

### Evaluation

* Basic techniques to assess response quality
* Identifying when outputs are unreliable

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Approach

This project includes a simple evaluation layer to:

* Detect low-quality responses
* Flag fallback or uncertain answers
* Provide a foundation for improving output reliability

This reflects real-world needs where **AI output must be monitored, not assumed correct**.

---

## 🛠️ Design Philosophy

This project is built with a strong focus on:

* **Developer Experience (DX)** → Clear onboarding and structure
* **Progressive Learning** → From simple usage to deeper concepts
* **Real-world relevance** → Focus on practical use cases
* **System thinking** → Not just “call API”, but “build a feature”

---

## 🎯 Who this is for

* Developers new to building AI-powered features
* Engineers exploring API-based AI systems
* Technical writers and DevRel professionals
* Anyone interested in improving AI usability in products

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Context-aware responses using external data (RAG)
* Advanced evaluation strategies
* Streaming responses and latency handling
* Tool usage and agent-based workflows

---

## 🤝 Why this matters

Modern AI development is shifting from:

> “Can we call the API?”

to:

> “Can we build something reliable, understandable, and usable?”

This project is a step toward that shift.
